# Bank-Application
### Purpose of the Project
The Banking Application is designed to streamline banking tasks, providing users with an efficient way to recharge their mobile phones and transfer money via NEFT. It aims to create a user-friendly experience by offering essential banking functionalities in a single application, making it convenient for users to manage transactions and track transaction history. With features like mobile recharge and NEFT transfer, the application effectively covers common banking needs while integrating with a backend database to store and retrieve data as required.

### Technologies Used
1. *Java Servlet*: Facilitates server-side handling of user requests and business logic for recharge and NEFT functions. It implements the MVC pattern, managing session data, and responding to user input.
2. *HTML/CSS*: Creates the application's frontend, providing a user interface with navigable pages like home, transaction history, and contact us.
3. *SQL*: Stores data for transactions, user details, and history logs, enabling efficient data management and retrieval in response to user actions.
